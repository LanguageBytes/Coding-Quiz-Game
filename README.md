When the user clicks the start button, the game will be displayed on the screen. The game has 5 questions with 4 available answers to choose from. When a question is answered, the user will be then be shown a new question. In the corner is a timer, time will be deducted if the answer is incorrect. After the user has answered all 5 questions, they will be prompted to enter their name and save their highscore. They will then be able to view the highscores on a separate page.
